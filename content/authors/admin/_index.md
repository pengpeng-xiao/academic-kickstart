#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi! ðŸ˜¸ I'm Pengpeng Xiao (è‚–èŠƒèŠƒ), a final year undergraduate student from [Department of Physics](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/), [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/). 
Starting in Fall 2025, I will begin my PhD at Yale University. My research interests lie in Scientific Machine learning (SciML), AI for Partial Differential Equations and AI for Science. 
I'm particularly interested in applying machine learning to PDE systems. 

Previously, I was a visiting student in [School of Computational Science and Engineering](https://cse.gatech.edu/)(CSE), Georgia Tech, 
working with [Prof. Peng Chen](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~pchen402/). I also spent time as a visiting student in [Department of Statistics and Data Science ](https://statistics.yale.edu/),
Yale University, where I worked with [Prof. Lu Lu](https://lugroup.yale.edu/).
