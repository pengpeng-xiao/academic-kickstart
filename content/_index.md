        My research journey began in **high-energy phenomenology**, where I explored fundamental physics and learned so much about the smallest scales of the universe. Over time, my interests expanded to the interplay between **physics and AI**, including the theoretical foundations of deep learning and quantum machine learning. Currently, I am particularly fascinated by the intersection of **generative AI and PDEs**, exploring how these techniques can enhance scientific computing and discovery. 

        I'm always open to collaborations! Feel free to reach out via **email** (p.xiao@yale.edu) or **WeChat** (luuuuuhan777) ðŸ˜ƒ
